This project may not work as expected because the paths for the Subscriptions.txt, ExtraOptions.txt and accessdb2.accdb may not be the 
same in your machine. 

You can change the path for the two txt files in the MainForm code and for the .accdb file you only have to change the value of the 
connectionString variable that can be found at the beginning of MainForm, Chart and Chart2.

Shortcuts: Alt+A - adds data entry in listView and database  
           DoubleClick anywhere on the MainForm - opens the database
